● Code does not follow Udacity HTML/CSS Style Guide. (http://goo.gl/0EVzNy)
	○ Required Formatting Changes​:
		■ CSS ­ Use Shorthand properties in all possible places. (See: CSS Style Rules­Shorthand Properties.)
		--> [Comment] Applied shorthand properties where applicable.
		■ Note​:	If you plan to configure more than one side of an element in margin​ or padding​,use margin and padding instead of the other margin and padding properties such as margin­top, padding­left, etc. margin ​and padding​ are more efficient for the browser to compute, speeding up your browser rendering times.
		--> [Comment] Most of the element uses only one side configuration, that is why I've used margin-(side) instead of margin. Is this recommended where only one side needs to be configured?
	○ Suggested Formatting Changes​:
		■ CSS ­ Use leading zeros for values in the code. (See: CSS Style Rules­Leading 0s.). Zero is an absolute number and has not unit of measurement.
		--> [Comment] Removed trailing zero after decimal.
